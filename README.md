# Customer Reviews Analysis Project

This project analyzes a dataset of 1000+ customer reviews to uncover key feedback themes using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature extraction, clustering, and topic modeling, with an interactive dashboard to visualize insights.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to use unsupervised learning methods to analyze customer reviews, identify prominent topics, and gain insights into customer sentiment. Key steps include:
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed irrelevant text and stopwords, and performed tokenization and stemming using NLTK.
- **Feature Extraction**: Transformed text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization.
- **Clustering**: Grouped reviews into distinct clusters with K-means to identify core feedback themes.
- **Topic Modeling**: Applied Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) within clusters to extract key topics from the reviews.
- **Visualization**: Created an interactive dashboard in Jupyter Notebook to present cluster distributions and primary topics.

## Key Technologies
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Numpy, Pandas, NLTK, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook

## Results
This project reveals clusters of common customer feedback and sentiment themes, visualized through an interactive dashboard that allows easy interpretation of complex insights for non-technical stakeholders.
